<a href="http://www.lassosoft.com/Tutorial-Understanding-Cookies-and-Sessions">Understanding Cookies and Sessions</a></p>

<p>Both cookies and sessions are available to you as a PHP developer, and both accomplish much the same task of storing data across pages on your site. However, there are differences between the two that will make each favourable in their own circumstance.</p>

<p>Cookies can be set to a long lifespan, which means that data stored in a cookie can be stored for months if not years. Cookies, having their data stored on the client, work smoothly when you have a cluster of web servers, whereas sessions are stored on the server, meaning in one of your web servers handles the first request, the other web servers in your cluster will not have the stored information.</p>

<p>Sessions are stored on the server, which means clients do not have access to the information you store about them - this is particularly important if you store shopping baskets or other information you do not want you visitors to be able to edit by hand by hacking their cookies. Session data, being stored on your server, does not need to be transmitted with each page; clients just need to send an ID and the data is loaded from the local file. Finally, sessions can be any size you want because they are held on your server, whereas many web browsers have a limit on how big cookies can be to stop rogue web sites chewing up gigabytes of data with meaningless cookie information.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, each have their own advantages, but at the end of the day it usually comes down one choice: do you want your data to work when you visitor comes back the next day? If so, then your only choice is cookies - if you have any particularly sensitive information, your best bet is to store it in a database, then use the cookie to store an ID number to reference the data. If you do not need semi-permanent data, then sessions are generally preferred, as they are a little easier to use, do not require their data to be sent in entirety with each page, and are also cleaned up as soon as your visitor closes their web browser.</p>

<p>Cookies and Sessions are inextricably intertwined, and fundamental to creating rich, interactive internet applications.</p>

What is a &quot;Cookie&quot;?
A cookie is a small piece of text stored on a user&#39;s computer by their browser. Common uses for cookies are authentication, storing of site preferences, shopping cart items, and server session identification.</p>

<p>Each time the users&#39; web browser interacts with a web server it will pass the cookie information to the web server. Only the cookies stored by the browser that relate to the domain in the requested URL will be sent to the server. This means that cookies that relate to www.example.com will not be sent to www.exampledomain.com.</p>

<p>In essence, a cookie is a great way of linking one page to the next for a user&#39;s interaction with a web site or web application.</p>

<p>What is a &quot;Session&quot;?
A session can be defined as a server-side storage of information that is desired to persist throughout the user&#39;s interaction with the web site or web application.</p>

<p>Instead of storing large and constantly changing information via cookies in the user&#39;s browser, only a unique identifier is stored on the client side (called a &quot;session id&quot;). This session id is passed to the web server every time the browser makes an HTTP request (ie a page link or AJAX request). The web application pairs this session id with it&#39;s internal database and retrieves the stored variables for use by the requested page.</p>

<p>Setting and reading cookies
Using the [cookie_set] method we can set cookies to store information for use in later pages. The following code shows how easy it is to store a user&#39;s details such as their name and email address which they may have entered on a &quot;Contact Us&quot; form. This would then allow later pages to pre-populate forms with this information.</p>

<p>Cookie_Set(
    &#39;UserDetails&#39;=&#39;John Doe|john.doe@example.com&#39;,
    -Domain=&#39;example.com&#39;,
    -Expires=&#39;1440&#39;,
    -Path=&#39;/&#39;
)
In this example the cookie named &quot;UserDetails&quot; contains the user name and email address delimited by a &quot;pipe&quot; character. This can be read and interpreted, then output in the following code.</p>

<p>local( userDetails = decode_url(cookie(&#39;UserDetails&#39;))-&gt;split(&#39;|&#39;))</p>

<p>if(#userDetails-&gt;size)=&gt;{^
    &#39;User Name = &#39;+#userDetails-&gt;get(1)
    &#39;<br />&#39;
    &#39;Email Address = &#39;+#userDetails-&gt;get(2)
^}
Using Sessions
To store information that is not appropriate to store client-side, we use sessions. Lasso has built in session handling, and deals with the setting and retrieval of the cookie itself. It will automatically set and retrieve the session id, which is the only thing stored client-side.</p>

<p>To set up a new session, we first start the session, then add to it the variables we would like to store in it. Those variables are stored within Lasso&#39;s session database.</p>

<p>// Start the session.
session_start(
    &#39;mySessionName&#39;,
    -expires = 1440,
    -usecookie=true
)</p>

<p>// Add variables to the session
if(session<em>result(&#39;mySessionName&#39;) != &#39;load&#39;) =&gt; {
    session</em>addVar(&#39;mySessionName&#39;, &#39;sv<em>userId&#39;)
    session</em>addVar(&#39;mySessionName&#39;, &#39;sv<em>userName&#39;)
    session</em>addVar(&#39;mySessionName&#39;, &#39;sv<em>userEmail&#39;)
    session</em>addVar(&#39;mySessionName&#39;, &#39;sv_favouriteColour&#39;)
}</p>

<p>!var<em>defined(&#39;sv</em>userId&#39;) ?     var(&#39;sv<em>userId&#39; = integer)
!var</em>defined(&#39;sv<em>userName&#39;) ?   var(&#39;sv</em>userName&#39; = string)
!var<em>defined(&#39;sv</em>userEmail&#39;) ?  var(&#39;sv<em>userEmail&#39; = string)
!var</em>defined(&#39;sv<em>favouriteColour&#39;) ?    var(&#39;sv</em>favouriteColour&#39; = &#39;red&#39;)</p>

<p>How this works:</p>

<p>Lines 2-6: Initializing the session. This needs to happen on every page you wish the session information to be readable and writable. Here we start a session named &#39;mySessionName&#39; with an idle expiry of 1440 minutes (1 day) and set to track via cookie.</p>

<p>Lines 9-14: The &quot;if&quot; conditional here checks to see if the session_result shows a new session and adds new vaiables to the session if it is new.</p>

<p>Lines 16-19: Each line in this section is checking if a variable has been defined, and if not then the variable is defined and declared with a default type and value.</p>

<p>The variables added to the session can now be used just like any other variable in the page. These variables are both readable and writiable. This means that when the value is changed, it will be stored in the session with the new value.</p>

<p>On subsequent pages if the session is initialized, you will be able to continue reading and modifying these variables.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting
If you&#39;re having problems with sessions, there are a few things to check.</p>

<p>Check the time on the server and the client PC
If the clock on the server and/or the client PC is incorrect, the session may expire prematurely. For example if your session idle expiry time is short (ie 15 minutes) and the clocks differ by greater than that amount, the session will expire before it can be used on the next page.</p>

<p>Ensure the client browser is accepting cookies
Browsers allow users to decide to not allow cookies to be set. If a user has blocked cookies you will have to use links to persist sessions. See the session documentation for more information.</p>
