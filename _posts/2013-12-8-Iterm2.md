[40 Terminal Tips](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/40-terminal-tips-and-tricks-you-never-thought-you-needed--mac-51192)

## move & delete word by word
By default in iterm2, you can't use `alt + <-` , `alt + ->` , `alt + delete` ,	`alt + D` to move or delete to left or to right.

But you can use `ctrl + <-` , `ctrl + ->` to move.  
( if not, maybe the global shortcut has taken it to `Preferance > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control`, disable it to release the shortcuts to the whole system. )

By setting `Preference > Profiles > Keys` as below, you could use `alt + <-` , `alt + ->` , `alt + delete` ,	`alt + D` again!
