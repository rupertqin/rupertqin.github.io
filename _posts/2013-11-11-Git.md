## Delete a Git branch both locally and in GitHub

Delete a **remote** branch:  
`git push origin --delete <branchName>`
  
`git push origin :<branchName>`  

To remove a **local branch** from your machine:  

`git branch -d the_local_branch`

## Example: pull then merge into another branch
my local 2 brach: **dev** **work**  
my working branch : **work**  
then I need to pull some new code from dev then merge into branch **work**  
``` bash

	on **work**: g stash  
	on **work**: gco dev  
	on **dev**: gl --rebase  
	on **dev**: gco work  
	on **work**: g rebase dev  
	on **work**: g stash pop
```
