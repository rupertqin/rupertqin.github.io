## Delete a Git branch both locally and in GitHub
Delete a **remote** branch:  
`git push origin --delete <branchName>`

`git push origin :<branchName>`  

To remove a **local branch** from your machine:  

`git branch -d the_local_branch`

## show changed files list between two revisions

    git diff --name-status master..dev

## Push local branch to remote
[why-do-i-need-to-do-set-upstream-all-the-time](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6089294/)

**`git push -u origin <branchName>`**

`git push -u origin <branchName>` = `git push origin <branchName>` + `git branch --set-upstream-to origin/my_branch`

`git branch --set-upstream-to origin/my_branch` = `git branch -u origin/my_branch`

## Pull remote branch to local
`git checkout -b <localName> origin/<remoteName>`

## Example: pull then merge into another branch
my local 2 brach: **dev** **work**  
my working branch : **work**  
then I need to pull some new code from dev then merge into branch **work**  

``` bash
on **work**: g stash  
on **work**: gco dev  
on **dev**: gl --rebase  
on **dev**: gco work  
on **work**: g rebase dev  
on **work**: g stash pop
```

## recover current changes
this recover current changes but do nothing with a commit  
__`git checkout -f`__  

PS: `git reset head~` will undo a head commit, but recover nothing.

## add or edit a remote url
[How to change a remote repository URI using Git?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432764)

via command:  

**add:** `git remote add origin ssh://newhost.com/usr/local/gitroot/myproject.git`

**set:** `git remote set-url origin ssh://newhost.com/usr/local/gitroot/newproject.git`

Check your local `repo-folder/.git/config` file for:

```
[remote "origin"]
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    url = https://user:password@code.google.com/p/project-name/
```

## git diff commit

`git log`

then find commit version string in such:

```bash
commit 48c47872e21283ec483b65a85cba7dac07dd60e0
Author: rup <uglysoul@foxmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 23 01:14:38 2014 +0800

    update post
```

then show target version with current HEAD:

`git diff 48c47872e21283ec483b65a85cba7dac07dd60e0 HEAD`

or previous version with previous' previous version:

`git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2`

or compare with commit string:

`git diff 48c47872e21283ec483b65a85cba7dac07dd60e0 f28a263731d3bd492a839037cbca4f12afcfcef4`

or

`git diff HEAD~2 f28a263731d3bd492a839037cbca4f12afcfcef4`

between branchs:

`git diff master dev`

## public key always asking for password and keyphrase

    eval `ssh-agent -s`
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


or put this code to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`  
[Working with SSH key passphrases](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#platform-windows)

    # Note: ~/.ssh/environment should not be used, as it
    #       already has a different purpose in SSH.

    env=~/.ssh/agent.env

    # Note: Don't bother checking SSH_AGENT_PID. It's not used
    #       by SSH itself, and it might even be incorrect
    #       (for example, when using agent-forwarding over SSH).

    agent_is_running() {
        if [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]; then
            # ssh-add returns:
            #   0 = agent running, has keys
            #   1 = agent running, no keys
            #   2 = agent not running
            ssh-add -l >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ $? -eq 1 ]
        else
            false
        fi
    }

    agent_has_keys() {
        ssh-add -l >/dev/null 2>&1
    }

    agent_load_env() {
        . "$env" >/dev/null
    }

    agent_start() {
        (umask 077; ssh-agent >"$env")
        . "$env" >/dev/null
    }

    if ! agent_is_running; then
        agent_load_env
    fi

    # if your keys are not stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub, you'll need
    # to paste the proper path after ssh-add
    if ! agent_is_running; then
        agent_start
        ssh-add
    elif ! agent_has_keys; then
        ssh-add
    fi

    unset env


## deleting-a-git-commit
[deleting-a-git-commit](http://clock.co.uk/blog/deleting-a-git-commit)

__way one:__

    git rebase --onto <branch name>~<first commit number to remove> <branch name>~<first commit to be kept> <branch name>
<!--  -->
e.g:

    git rebase --onto repair~3 repair~1 repair
    git rebase -i HEAD~5

__way two:__

    git checkout b3d92c5 Checkout the last usable commit.
    git checkout -b repair Create a new branch to work on.
    git cherry-pick 77b9b82 Run through commit 3.
    git cherry-pick 2c6a45b Run through commit 1.
    git checkout master Checkout master.
    git reset --hard b3d92c5 Reset master to last usable commit.
    git merge repair Merge our new branch onto master.
    git push --hard origin master Push master to the remote repo.


## Force Git to overwrite local files on pull

```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```
