## Basic SVN commands

### Committing files

Will show you the changes you've made since you last did an svn update on the file.

    svn diff <filename>


It will merge changes made to the file in the repository with the changes you have on your machine. Your own changes take precedence and these are preserved. However, conflicts may arise if any of the lines that have been modified on your machine have been changed in the repository since you last checked it out/svn-updated it.

    svn update <filename>

Where the message string is one that explains what changes have been made, why you are committing the file or what purpose a new file serves.

    svn commit - m "message" <filename>
